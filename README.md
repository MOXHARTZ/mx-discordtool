# Introduction
This is a discord bot for your fivem server. It has a lot of features and is easy to setup. It is made for ESX and QB. <b>I'm still working on it and adding new features.</b> If you have any suggestions create an issue on github. If you want to help me, you can open a pull request.

# About the features and bugs
If you find a bug or want to suggest a new feature, you can open an issue on github. If you want to help me, you can open a pull request. But please don't send me a message on discord for bugs and features. I can't answer all of them. If you want to ask something, you can join my discord server.
